Controlled-NOT (CNOT) Gate: This is a two-qubit gate that applies an X gate (bit-flip)
on the target qubit if the control qubit is in the |1⟩ state. The matrix representation
of CNOT is:

makefile

CNOT = | 1 0 0 0 |
       | 0 1 0 0 |
       | 0 0 0 1 |
       | 0 0 1 0 |

Controlled-Pauli-Y (CY) Gate: This two-qubit gate applies a Pauli-Y gate on the
target qubit if the control qubit is in the |1⟩ state. The matrix representation of CY is:

makefile

CY = | 1 0 0  0  |
     | 0 1 0  0  |
     | 0 0 0 -1j |
     | 0 0 1j  0 |

Controlled-Pauli-Z (CZ) Gate: This two-qubit gate applies a Pauli-Z gate on the target
qubit if the control qubit is in the |1⟩ state. The matrix representation of CZ is:

makefile

CZ = | 1 0 0  0 |
     | 0 1 0  0 |
     | 0 0 1  0 |
     | 0 0 0 -1 |

Controlled-U (CU) Gate: This two-qubit gate applies an arbitrary single-qubit unitary gate U on the
target qubit if the control qubit is in the |1⟩ state. The matrix representation of CU
depends on the specific unitary U.

Toffoli (CCNOT) Gate: This is a three-qubit gate that applies an X gate on the target qubit if
both control qubits are in the |1⟩ state. The Toffoli gate is also known as the
Controlled-Controlled-NOT gate. The matrix representation of Toffoli is:

makefile

Toffoli = | 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 |
          | 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 |
          | 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 |
          | 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 |
          | 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 |
          | 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 |
          | 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 |
          | 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 |

Fredkin (CSWAP) Gate: This is a three-qubit gate that swaps the states of the second and
third qubits if the control qubit (first qubit) is in the |1⟩ state. The Fredkin gate is
also known as the Controlled-SWAP gate. The matrix representation of Fredkin is:

makefile

    Fredkin = | 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 |
              | 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 |
              | 0 0
